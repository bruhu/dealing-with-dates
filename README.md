# Self-guided: Dealing with Dates

(Week 2, Day2)

## Learning Goals

**By the end of this lesson you will be able to:**

- Recall the basic functions and methods available in Python and the Pandas library for handling date-type data, such as `to_datetime()`, `strftime()`, `timedelta()`, and the `dt` accessor.
- Interpret the functionality of the datetime module in Python, its role in data analysis, and the specific purpose of each method and parameter in handling date-related data.
- Apply these date handling techniques in Python to convert string-type columns to datetime, manipulate date formats, extract components from dates, and manage errors in date conversions.
